oUF_Gvv
=======

A GW2-like oUF layout for World of Warcraft. [Click here for preview.](https://github.com/Raka-loah/oUF_Gvv/blob/master/preview.jpg)

Known Issues:
- I'm no longer a jobless gamer like 10 years ago, I'm a father now and have a full-time job to financially support my family. Thus this addon is not actively developed.
- Only tested on my Evoker. Maybe my Shaman after CN region TWW is up.

Usage:
- oUF_Gvv_buttons is a small script to apply hotkey styles for Bartender4 only. You can freely disable it if you don't like it.
- Masque:Zoomed skin is recommend when using oUF_Gvv_buttons.

Current Version: v0.8.0

Changes in this version:

- oUF 12.0.x adaption.
