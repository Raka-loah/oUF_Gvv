oUF_Gvv
=======

**~~Discontinued due to faith in Blizzard lost~~**

Continued a little bit further for now.

**Will be discontinued after Jan. 23, 2023 due to CN region server shutting down.**


A GW2-like oUF layout for World of Warcraft. [Click here for preview.](https://github.com/Raka-loah/oUF_Gvv/blob/master/preview.jpg)


Ps. Masque_Gvv will not register a skin in Masque anymore. Instead, it will only modify Bartender4 action button hotkey text styles. Use Masque Zoom skin with Masque_Gvv enabled to achieve a similar effect like before.


Current Version: v0.7.0

Changes in this version:

- oUF 11.1.x adaption.


**WARNING: Really really early stage in development. Only tested on my Evoker.**
